The output board:
The two squares beside the SCORE is the decimal score of the player; how many expressions he or she computed correctly. On the other side of the same line are another two squares. It will show two decimal numbers representing the countdown from 60s to 0s

Below it are 3 squares.
The two hexadecimal and one operator in the middle is the 3 squares in the middle part of the board
